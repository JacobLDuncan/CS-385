# Assignment 1 - Git Repository Setup & WebGL Explorations
Site:	https://map.newworld.com/en-us/
		
After looking through various sites that use WebGL, I found this one to be the most intereting & useful.
It is based on the MMO game New World that was released last year. The site provides a 3-D verison of the game's map for the user to explore. 
I enjoyed how interactive the site was, as it allows for the user to move around the map & look points of interest. 
The user can then learn more about different parts of the map as they are reavealed by the cursor. I could see this site as being a
good supplement for a player of the game, giving them a more detailed & informative map to use beyond the one provided by the game.
